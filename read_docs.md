adding the zig language reference and stdlib docs requires strategic approach for maximum efficiency:
1. start with language reference basics - focus on:
   - section 2 (lexical structure)
   - section 3 (values)
   - section 9 (expressions)
   - build foundation before diving into complex features
2. for stdlib consumption:
   - begin w/ root.zig module to understand overall organization
   - prioritize 'std' namespace structure first
   - use zigdoc/ziglang.org for auto-generated function signatures
3. pattern recognition techniques:
   - identify common naming conventions (camelCase for functions, etc)
   - study error handling patterns extensively
   - learn to recognize allocator patterns quickly
4. tactical reading:
   - use fully compiled examples as reference points
   - examine test cases for practical usage examples
   - trace function call hierarchies to understand relationships
5. specific high-value sections in stdlib:
   - std.mem (memory mgmt fundamentals)
   - std.fmt (formatting core)
   - std.fs (filesystem interactions)
   - std.testing (essential for validating understanding)
6. focus on documentation comments directly above functions rather than standalone docs.
7. install zigup for managing multiple zig versions; master stdlib may evolve faster than your project needs.

time invested in understanding comptime paradigms will pay exponential dividends later.
